At present, this page is mostly just a list of links to some advice on the internet that I've found helpful over the years (by years, I mean, like, the last two or three). The second section is a running list of lessons that I think I've learned over the last six months working in technology; perhaps, to a certain extent, some of those lessons may have been emergent given more fundamental lessons learned while running a kitchen at an addiction treatment center, though my running assumption is that they are not, because (for better or worse) most of my intellectual energy there was spent on things I found more immediate than learning lessons.

>Despite the near universality of the maxim that one should treat others as one ought to be treated, even well-intended advisers often advise others to act differently than they choose for themselves. We review several psychological factors that contribute to biased advice. Absent pecuniary motives to the contrary, advice tends to be paternalistically biased in favor of caution. Policies that would intuitively promote quality advice — such as making advisers accountable, taking advice from advisers who value the relationship, or having advisers disclose potential conflicts of interest — can perversely lower the quality of advice

## lessons 
repository of lessons learned from my experience at various companies over the course of my career. The inspiration from this note came from a conversation with my father on Sunday, March 24 (2024) after a brief conversation that went something like the following: 

> Me:  I don't like working for other people
> 
> Dad: (Laughs) neither do I. I don't think I've ever been very good at it.
> 
> Me: How did [BroadJump](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/broadjump) start? Whose idea was it?
> 
> Dad: Kip, Kenny, and (~). And then they brought me in and I raised the money.
> 
> Me: How old were you?
> 
> Dad: We were pregnant with you. Must have been 1998.
> 
> Me: So you were 32.
> 
> Dad: I trust your math.
> 
> Me: That's young. I better get going!
> 
> Dad: You've got plenty of time. You need to focus on learning what **not** to do. One of the best engineers I ever worked with at Tipping point, when he came in from a previous company, he brought with him a list of all of the things that were messed up at his previous company.

> Me: {babbles something about information theory}
> 
> Dad: yeah
> 
> Me: That's good advice. Thanks.


### Apex (June 2023 - )

1. Have a well documented plan before hiring people. Have materials for those people to learn from before bringing them in. Good onboarding is important. 
2. Agree on a heuristic for defining and naming features up front, and open those up when needed. Keep everything written in one place. 
3. If someone cannot write down their ideas, then those ideas did not exist. No matter how quickly a company moves, if you cannot document what you have learned, you will be destined to continue to repeat the process. Information that is not shared and documented might as well have never existed. 
4. (corollary): cultivate a culture of writing, sharing, and collaborating. **Ban powerpoints.** Power points for internal discussions are counter productive. Let the truth win out. 
5. Accounts should be able to belong to multiple parent groups. A given entity should be able to have different levels of authorization on different groups of accounts. 
6. When completely changing your service architecture and data schema, it's probably worth it to think about how to make that transition invisible to your clients. 
7. Product-led growth doesn't work until a product exists and has users. Product and sales need to be tied at the hip. 
8. use *agile* **principles** where they apply. *Agile* **processes** are a waste of time and money. 
9. Protect the developers time at all costs. 
10. Have a general distrust of meetings. The burden of proof should be on the meeting creator to determine whether the meeting is required. 
11. Don't hire as a short term solution. If hiring at an organization with many teams, it may be beneficial to delay the time for a new hire to join a team so as to incorporate them into the organization first before the team. This also mitigates accidentally hiring someone to fix a short term problem that may have underlying systemic problems. 
12. Make all emails visible to all employees at all times. Open repository of information and communication. This sates curiosity and saves time that may be otherwise spent on "touching base". Also, selects against people who may be prone to horde information.
