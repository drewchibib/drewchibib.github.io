This page contains advice I've found helpful and things I've learned in my early career which might be helpful to others. Vocational only.

>Despite the near universality of the maxim that one should treat others as one ought to be treated, even well-intended advisers often advise others to act differently than they choose for themselves. Absent pecuniary motives to the contrary, _advice tends to be paternalistically biased in favor of caution_. Policies that would intuitively promote quality advice — such as making advisers accountable, taking advice from advisers who value the relationship, or having advisers disclose potential conflicts of interest — can perversely lower the quality of advice. 



## lessons 
repository of lessons learned from my experience at various companies over the course of my career, mostly related to working in technology. To a certain extent, some of these lessons may have been emergent, given more fundamental lessons learned while running a kitchen at an outpatient treatment center, though my running assumption is that they are not, because (for better or worse) most of my intellectual energy there was spent on things I found more immediate than learning lessons. 

1. Be thoughtful and careful about naming new things. Abstractions are powerful and should not be taken lightly. Think on long time horizons.  
2. If someone cannot write down their ideas, then those ideas did not exist. No matter how quickly a company moves, if you cannot document what you have learned, you will be destined to continue to repeat the process. Information that is not shared and documented might as well have never existed.  
3. (Corollary): Cultivate a culture of writing, sharing, and collaborating.  
4. Processes are a tool for getting better outcomes; _Good_ process is a loose correlate for good outcomes. *As soon as process becomes the proxy for the actual desired result*, something is wrong. 
5. Use *agile* **principles** where they apply. *Agile* **processes** are a waste of time and money. 
6. Have a general distrust of meetings. The burden of proof should be on the meeting creator to determine whether the meeting is required.  
7. Don't hire as a short-term solution. If hiring at an organization with many teams, it may be beneficial to delay the time for a new hire to join a team so as to incorporate them into the organization first before the team. This also mitigates accidentally hiring someone to fix a short-term problem that may have underlying systemic causes.  
8. Teams should be small, focused, and driven to create their own semi-autonomous world of excellence.  
9. Work on important things. [Richard Hamming](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html) puts it best:  
    > “If what you are doing is not important, and if you don’t think it is going to lead to something important, why are you working on it?”  
10. [Procrastination isn't necessarily bad](https://archive.is/JpgVN#selection-9.0-9.8288).
11. There isn't always a best answer. Make the best decision with the information at hand, move on, measure against desired outcome, update input variables, repeat.
