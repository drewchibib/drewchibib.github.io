At present, this page is mostly just a list of links to some advice on the internet that I've found helpful over the years (by years, I mean, like, the last two or three). The second section is a running list of lessons that I think I've learned over the last six months working in technology; perhaps, to a certain extent, some of those lessons may have been emergent given more fundamental lessons learned while running a kitchen at an addiction treatment center, though my running assumption is that they are not, because (for better or worse) most of my intellectual energy there was spent on things I found more immediate than learning lessons. 

## some links 
- [10 things from Nabeel Qureshi](https://nabeelqu.co/advice)
- [Advice vs. Choice](https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.copsyc.2015.08.019) (emphasis added): 
>Despite the near universality of the maxim that one should treat others as one ought to be treated, even well-intended advisers often advise others to act differently than they choose for themselves. Absent pecuniary motives to the contrary, _advice tends to be paternalistically biased in favor of caution_. Policies that would intuitively promote quality advice — such as making advisers accountable, taking advice from advisers who value the relationship, or having advisers disclose potential conflicts of interest — can perversely lower the quality of advice. 

## lessons 
repository of lessons learned from my experience at various companies over the course of my career (which, at present, spans about eight months [citation needed]). Hopefully long and rewarding. The inspiration from this note came from a conversation with my father on Sunday, March 24 (2024) after a brief conversation that went something like the following: 

> Me:  I don't like working for other people
> 
> Dad: (Laughs) neither do I. I don't think I've ever been very good at it.
> 
> Me: How did [BroadJump](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/broadjump) start? Whose idea was it?
> 
> Dad: Kip, Kenny, and (~). And then they brought me in and I raised the money.
> 
> Me: How old were you?
> 
> Dad: We were pregnant with you. Must have been 1998.
> 
> Me: So you were 32.
> 
> Dad: I trust your math.
> 
> Me: That's young. I better get going!
> 
> Dad: You've got plenty of time. You need to focus on learning what **not** to do. One of the best engineers I ever worked with at Tipping point, when he came in from a previous company, he brought with him a list of all of the things that were messed up at his previous company.

> Me: {babbles something about information theory}
> 
> Dad: yeah
> 
> Me: That's good advice. Thanks.



1. Be thoughtful and careful about naming new things. Abstractions are powerful and should not be taken lightly. Think on long time horizons.  
2. If someone cannot write down their ideas, then those ideas did not exist. No matter how quickly a company moves, if you cannot document what you have learned, you will be destined to continue to repeat the process. Information that is not shared and documented might as well have never existed.  
3. (Corollary): Cultivate a culture of writing, sharing, and collaborating.  
4. Accounts should be able to belong to multiple parent groups. A given entity should be able to have different levels of authorization on different groups of accounts.  
5. When completely changing your service architecture and data schema, it's probably worth it to think about how to make that transition invisible to your clients.  
6. Product-led growth doesn't work until a product exists and has users. Until then, product and sales need to be tied at the hip.
7. Processes are a tool for getting better outcomes; _Good_ process is a loose correlate for good outcomes. *As soon as process becomes the proxy for the actual desired result*, something is wrong. 
8. Use *agile* **principles** where they apply. *Agile* **processes** are a waste of time and money. 
9. Have a general distrust of meetings. The burden of proof should be on the meeting creator to determine whether the meeting is required.  
10. Don't hire as a short-term solution. If hiring at an organization with many teams, it may be beneficial to delay the time for a new hire to join a team so as to incorporate them into the organization first before the team. This also mitigates accidentally hiring someone to fix a short-term problem that may have underlying systemic causes.  
11. Make all communications visible to all employees at all times. Open repository of information and communication. This sates curiosity and saves time that may be otherwise spent on "touching base." Also, it selects against people who may be prone to hoard information. It turns out that people act differently when others are watching, and the gradient of that difference usually tends towards kindness (feigned or not—kindness is kindness). Privacy is good, usually, but there is no reason to enforce any sort of factional information siloes where those sorts of things aren't beholden to some sort of hard regulatory regime.  
12. Teams should be small, focused, and driven to create their own semi-autonomous world of excellence.  
13. Work on important things. [Richard Hamming](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html) puts it best:  
    > “If what you are doing is not important, and if you don’t think it is going to lead to something important, why are you working on it?”  
14. [Procrastination is OK](https://archive.is/JpgVN#selection-9.0-9.8288).
15. There isn't always a best answer. Make the best decision with the information at hand, move on, measure against desired outcome, update input variables, repeat.
