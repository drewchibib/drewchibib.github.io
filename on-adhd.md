1.  **Introduction**

The rapid increase in rates of mental disorders over the past few decades can be explained by a corresponding shift in the economic base. Some Marxist historians (Cohen 2016, Fisher 2009) have argued that these increases should be attributed to the dismantling of the welfare state and rapid globalization of the latter-half of the 20^th^ century.[^1] The above claims proceed from a methodology, following Lewontin and Levins (1996, 2000), that analyzes the sciences as part of the institutional and ideological superstructure of capitalism. In what follows, I show 1) that the shift in science's location of mental illness (i.e., from the immaterial 'psyche' to observable realm of neurobiology) is a symptom of a material shift towards neoliberal capitalism in the post-Fordist era; and 2) that the concomitant institutional and ideological changes of this shift are, at least, partly to blame for an empirical rise in ADHD diagnoses over that period.[^2]

I would do well to note that, to some extent, this argument is of the form laid out by Levins (2000), with the caveat, of course, that we are not here talking of infectious disease, but a disease of a much more ontologically messy sort (i.e., mental illness). Proceeding from the notion that "with any major change in the way of life of a population ... there will also be a change in our relationship with pathogens, their reservoirs, and with the vectors of disease," we begin with an outline of what exactly, in this context, the contours of the "major change in the way of life" might be (Levins 2000: 4). From there, I draw from anthropological accounts of psychiatry in practice (Metzel 2009, Lakoff 2009) to provide an empirical account of the shift in location of mental illness. Then, acknowledging the relationship between the superstructure and means of diagnosis, I summarize the economic and clinical history of ADHD, before connecting the most modern of its symptoms to broader symptoms of "late capitalism".[^3] This latter claim is more or less an expansion of Levins' (2000) hypothesis qua the creation of a "sick society" (Levins 2000: 10).

**2. Shifts in the economic base from 1970-2000**

To the matter of context, then. It's generally the consensus, among historians who use the terms (i.e., Fordism and Post-Fordism), that the shift towards neoliberalism happened sometime between the 1970s and the 1990s. To avoid going into the weeds on the matter, there was a broad shift in US (and global) monetary policy during this period, which allowed a rapid shift in business ontology, organization of means of production, and global trade.[^4] Privatization and deregulation feature prominently in this evolution. As events of note, you have: the establishment of NAFTA, the opening of the Chinese economy, and the implementation of structural adjustment in the third world by the IMF and World Bank.

Qualitatively speaking, Fordism was characterized---for laborers---by loud and demanding working conditions that eliminated the possibility of communication. Manufacturing jobs moved overseas, state services were privatized, austerity measures enforced, capital became even more inescapably globalized. All of this, of course, was scaffolded by the growing ideological consensus (advertised, in no small part, by think tanks like the CATO institute, etc.) that "human well-being can best be advanced by liberating individual entrepreneurial freedoms and skills within an institutional framework characterized by strong private property rights, free markets, and free trade" (Cohen 2016: 82).[^5] This ideological consensus had, by the time Reagan left office, become hegemonic. Business jargon moved into the realm of everyday language, education, and self-help---students are now taught "efficiency" or "time-management," self-help books are written to boost "productivity," we seek to espouse an "entrepreneurial mindset," etc.)---even economic and health-outcome inequality was presented as a consequence of individual choice (Levins 2000: 20). This ideological shift---particularly, the growing emphasis on the individual, the self, and personal responsibility---is where I proceed in my analysis of psychiatric practice. The topic is much too broad to cover in full here, but the foundation of what follows could be well described as Foucauldian (Cohen 2016), and so I am careful to resituate my analysis within the scaffolding of class and the capitalist mode of production.

**3. Psychiatry in Practice: Ethnographic accounts of shifting diagnostic criteria**

The neoliberal emphasis on the individual, self-governance, and moral personal responsibility, to reiterate, can be clearly traced to the concomitant shifts in productive relations over that period. I look now to bring those emphases to bear on the psychiatric sciences (in what follows, the "psy-sciences"). Following Nikolas Rose (1999), I should note that the psy-sciences have situated themselves, in a way, as a new science of the soul, which is particularly amenable to the ideological context of neoliberalism:

> Through self-inspection, self-problematization, self-monitoring, and confession, we evaluate ourselves according to the criteria provided for us by others. Through self-reformation, therapy, techniques of body alteration, and calculated reshaping of speech and emotion, we adjust ourselves by means of the techniques propounded by the experts of the soul \[meaning, the psy-professionals\].
>
> Rose (1999: 11).

To be sure, and this has presented a consistent problem for the psy-sciences, what exactly in the world the "soul," "psyche," or "mind" might point to is unclear. If mental health interventions are to be legitimized scientifically, abstract conceptions of the individual must be translated onto and made inseparable from things in the world. My analysis reaffirms Bruno Latour (1999: 270) in asserting that this process "requires \[an\] ongoing stabilization of the network of actors and techniques through which the fact is produced". Biomedical psychiatry, which began, effectively, with the sequencing of the first genomes in the 1970s, attempts to finalize this stabilization by making the psyche material, i.e., locating it (and mental illness with it) in the brain.[^6] Of course, with this ontology of mental illness, treatment is no longer the responsibility of the psychoanalyst, but rather, of the pharmacist (Lakoff 2009).[^7]

But the purported effects of medication, the individual responses to it, and the means for determining the population of patients who should be administered the medication in the first place are subject to interpretation. Borrowing from Levins (2000:19-20), who suggests that it would be perfectly "good" science to suggest---and subsequently prove---that crime is genetic and hereditary, I suggest that the biomedical explanation of mental illness, which can only be adjusted/proved in relation to the method of its treatment, is incomplete. Understanding---and thus, treating---mental illness as a problem of biomechanics is too narrow an approach.[^8] I earnestly note that this paper in no way means to devalue, interrupt, or in any way demean the experiences of those with mental illnesses. In some ways, those experiences are social and political---that is where this analysis interjects. In many other important (and often more powerful) ways, those experiences are their (i.e., those with mental illness) own. That is where this analysis ends.

**4. ADHD and superstructure**

In the summer of 1994, Roger Griggs---a former high school football coach and owner of the pharmaceutical company Rexal---rebranded the obscure weight-loss drug Obetrol. He called it "Adderal," which was shorthand for "ADD for All". Here Alan Schwartz (2013) provides a relatively disheartening account:

> "Griggs wasn't sure whether the application would actually be approved or not until he received a call from a 'well-connected Washington lobbyist,' who told him that a US Senator was furious with the fact that his son could no longer obtain Adderall. 'You're golden,' the lobbyist assured Griggs. And sure enough, the application was approved, ADHD became a blockbuster, and Griggs sold Richwood to Shire Pharmaceuticals for a cool \$186 million" (Shwartz 2013).

And so, with the help of one lobbyist, one senator, and one ex-high-school football coach, the ADHD stimulant-drug-treatment industry began. In the 25 years since its effective inception, profits have skyrocketed---\$9 billion of stimulants were sold in 2012, almost a ten-fold increase in 10 years (IMS Health, 2016)---and the industry has grown to include psychiatric researchers, marketing agencies, lobbyists, and politicians. In 2018 pharmaceutical industry invested \$280 million in lobbying, with over 1,441 lobbyists active in Washington, and the amount of money contributed increased every year from 1998 to 2009 (Center for Responsive Politics, 2018). Furthermore, the number of ADHD diagnoses continue to increase. Some 15% of children in the U.S. will be diagnosed with ADHD by the end of their childhood, and the number of children on medication has risen to 3.5 million from 600,000 in 1990. How did this psy-political and economic apparatus grow so quickly? How did researchers and pharmaceutical companies manage to curtail bad press surrounding corruption and the severity of drug-induced side effects? The addictiveness of stimulant drugs used to treat ADHD were well-known; first marketed as a decongestant and eventually used in the U.S. military to improve endurance and stamina of pilots, stimulant use in the U.S. was already widespread and researched, and thousands became addicted:

> "...by 1962, 80,000 kg of amphetamine was being produced annually in the US, translating into some 8 billion typical 10mg doses, or approximately 43 doses for every single person in the country each year. 'The original amphetamine epidemic,' he asserts, 'was generated by the pharmaceutical industry and medical profession as a byproduct of routine commercial drug development and competition'"

(Rasmussen 2008: 6)

There is no standardized test for ADHD, either (at least, not in the same sense that one might detect, say, strep throat). In the last instance, ADHD diagnoses are contingent on the insistence of parents and/or the interpretation of psychiatrists.[^9] But note that this can occur with varying degrees of causal certainty---pharmaceutical companies need not always bribe doctors, and parents need not always be overeager. Indeed, here we would do well to consider the ways that science (i.e., fact-making and fact-keeping) is contingent on the economic base in more subtle ways.[^10]

There is a direct relationship between the above noted pharmaceutical economic boom and the psychiatric consensus on the disorder---the diagnostic criteria for ADHD have broadened in scope with each new edition of the DSM. It first appeared in the DSM-II in 1968 as "Hyperkinetic reaction to childhood", which limited the diagnosis to explicitly hyperactive children. In 1980, the DSM-III presented Attention-Deficit Disorder---with or without hyperactivity---an age-blind diagnosis that made possible diagnoses without observable hyperactivity. In 1994 (the same year, I am careful to note, that Adderall was sold to Shire Pharmaceuticals), the DSM-IV developed a diagnostic framework with three subtypes: ADHD-I (inattentive presentation), ADHD-II (with hyperactive presentation), and ADHD-III (with dual presentation). This diagnostic shift directly corresponds to the meteoric rise in diagnoses and prescriptions. According to the CDC, in the 10 years after the DSM-IV's redefinition and expansion of ADHD diagnostic criteria in 1994, 12 new drugs were approved by the FDA for treatment of ADHD, including Concerta, Vyvanse, Focalin, and Strattera.[^11]

The rapid development of a diverse market of new prescription drugs saw an equally intense onslaught of new advertisements to ensure their demand, especially after the United States began allowing direct-to-consumer (DTC) drug advertisements in 2001. Drug sales skyrocketed. In general, stimulant (i.e., medications for treating ADHD) ads emphasized their efficacy in curtailing non-disciplined, underachieving, or deviant behavior.[^12] A magazine ad for Concerta, for example, shows a grateful mother saying, 'Better test scores at school, more chores done at home, an independence I try to encourage, and a smile I can always count on."

The relationship between marketing strategies, government policy, and demand for a commodity whose sale requires a psychiatric diagnosis is useful for two reasons. (1) it provides a glimpse into how pharmaceutical companies actively worked to project a tailored, if not distorted, image of ADHD drugs and their effectiveness, and (2) the success of these advertisements, which meant the sale of the commodities, which in turn meant the diagnosis of the patient, emphasizes the constraints by which the economic base shapes psychiatric knowledge. And this 'shaping' owes its success, in no small part, to the broader economic and political shifts of the late 20^th^ century outlined above.

**5. Conclusion: hyperstimulation, "late capitalism," and sickness**

I have made clear the problems of psychiatry, at least from a sociological perspective.[^13] That said, I am careful not to claim too much in what follows, rather, only to hazard an explanation. Furthermore---to reiterate---in illustrating the material and ideological scaffolding of modern psychiatry I don't mean to suggest that mental illness is "made up," in any sense. There is a certain fluidity of diagnosis in the psy-sciences which makes it (i.e., psychiatry) particularly amenable to the neoliberal ethos, to be sure, and there are material incentives *against* finding cures for mental illness in the pharmaceutical industry. But they (i.e., the psy-sciences) point to something, some sorts of "problems in living" which shouldn't be ignored.[^14] Not only have the number of diagnoses---and the means of diagnosing them (see above)---increased, but there is at least an empirical proliferation of unease, self-reported and otherwise, that has increased somewhere between six- and 35-fold since 1955 (Cohen 2016: 17). [^15]

A social explanation of mental illness isn't novel, either. Taking a social, ecological approach to the study of mental illnesses suggests that everyone has the capacity to suffer some sort of mental discomfort (of course, some more than others). Indeed, even the WHO (2013, emphasis added) acknowledges as much: "*Depending on the local context*, certain individuals and groups in society may be placed at a significantly higher risk of experiencing mental health problems". In a broad sense, the economic and ideological shift of the late 20^th^ century mandated new ways of being-in-the-world. Our lives have become, to an extent, a proliferation of images; products can be marketed more aggressively and more often, to the point where advertising works on the level of the subconscious. No longer do ads attempt to make a logical argument for the consumption of the commodity by stressing its (the commodity's) superiority or use-value; instead, the commodity is directly related to the consumer's subconscious, to their identity. Women will faun over you if you wear this cologne. If you take this medication, you'll have the happy family you always wanted. You can be just like Cardi B if you drink Pepsi.

In this context, the individual is marketed to when they seek pleasure (e.g., scrolling through social media), and they often even seek pleasure in marketing (e.g., watching the Super Bowl). The result is that the consumer is placed into what Mark Fisher (2009) calls "a state of apathetic hedonia"---the everyday has become so saturated with information and stimulation that one is desensitized to it, accustomed to receiving some degree of entertainment or stimulation at a whim. Often---and this is something I see in my professional life---students "need" to take stimulant drugs to complete their reading assignments and write papers.[^16] Caught in between the realities of disciplinary requirements of school (or work) and the pounding, violent imperative to be entertained constantly, it's no surprise that the number of people self-reporting some symptoms of "mental distress" has risen so dramatically.

The anxieties about success, achievement, and one's inability to focus given such constant stimulation provides a potential cause for the rise in U.S. ADHD diagnoses. To be sure, stimulant medications have a remarkable potential for increasing one's capacity to focus and work efficiently. But one must wonder whether this is an entirely good thing. Given the frequency with which children as young as two or three are prescribed them (I myself was on either Concerta, Adderall, or Vyvanse from age 5 to age 18), and the resulting side effects (which include insomnia, mental fatigue, decreased appetite, and even hallucinations), the distribution of these medications is something which we must certainly at least bring into question.

And to make matters worse, it has become almost a *faux pas* to discuss the social determinants of the disorder; that is, potential underlying causes of the disorder aren't addressed at a meaningful level. To recall, not only is the biomedical approach ineffective (Cohen 2016), but exacerbates existing inequity, racial and otherwise (Metzel 2009, WHO 2013). In summary, to consider ADHD as a strictly individualized neurobiological problem does two things. 1) It reinforces the neoliberal emphasis on individuality and self-responsibility through a dialectical, mutually constitutive relationship between psychiatry and the economic base. 2)It provides an incredibly lucrative market---there is money in the research, sale, and production of the medications that 'treat' the disorder---and the market will ensure only the continued sale, prescription, and diagnosis of ADHD and ADHD medication. There is no other viable approach than an integrative one, and with this there are both academic and policy-related concerns. We who have a voice in these sorts of matters---in and out of academia---would do well to heed them.

[^1]: I use the term "Marxist" here with full acknowledgement of its ambiguity, as noted by the instructor over the course of the semester. This paper will draw primarily from Levins (2000), at least theoretically, and expands on the argument given by Cohen (2016), to whom I owe a great deal of inspiration. The reader will do well to note that this argument is not, however, strictly Cohen's or Levins', and draws also from works in critical theory (Fisher 2009) as well as anthropology (Metzel 2009, Lakoff 2009).

[^2]: I have tried at varying points in writing this paper to use both "neoliberalism" and "post-Fordism". Neither are fully satisfactory. N.B., there is certainly an argument to be made that neither term point to a shift in the economic base, because the fundamental relations of production haven't changed (i.e., the economy is still run by the capitalist's purhcase of the worker's labor power). as See Fisher (2009) for more on the shift from Fordism to post Fordism as a cultural phenomenon. For our purposes, it's sufficient to note that this shift occurred sometime between the late 1970s to 1990s, as part of the global shift towards neoliberalism, an economic change (in America) which the gradual movement away from paternalistic, assembly-line employment.

[^3]: Here I use "late capitalism" to refer more to a related set of theoretical works (see: Fisher 2009, or Frederic Jameson's *Postmodernism, or, the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism* \[1991\]), as opposed to an actual historical/material stage of capitalism. I make no claims as to whether we're in "late capitalism," and to do so would be outside the scope of this paper.

[^4]: I consulted some primary source material to justify this claim (Rolnick et al., 1979), though no data is explicitly used here. Re: healthcare, I am referring to the general philosophy of the WHO after their abandonment of the resolutions of the Alma-Ata conference. For more on neoliberalism, development, and healthcare policy, see Packard (2016: 259-264).

[^6]: This development finds its logical conclusion in the present use of AI software to predict, diagnose, and treat mental illness. For more on these unnerving examples, See Zarei (2021) and Huckins (2021) in *Wired* magazine.

[^7]: By extension, this also makes mental illness---or, relatedly, any other unease of the mind---the object of technology. It was around this time that the Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) became a standard method of analysis. In what is nominally a "hypothesis free" method of analysis---it is purported to be nothing more than ideologically bereft data-mining---geneticists harvest the genomes of participants with and without given diagnoses, comparing the specifics of the genome to determine a statistically significant correlation between allele and disease pathology. See Rose (2019) for more on the relationship between tech and ontology of psychiatric disorders.

[^8]: This goes without saying, but (other than my relative ignorance on matters of neurobiology) the narrowness of this approach is the primary motivation for my omission of any discussion of the legitimacy of neurobiological explanations of ADHD or the efficacy of pharmaceutical treatment.

[^9]: I should note, too, that sometimes one doesn't even need a psychiatrist. In the manner outlined above (i.e., where treatment shapes definition and diagnostic criteria of a disease), people will refer to themselves as ADHD positive after just receiving a prescription---which can be given by a general practitioner. In a very real sense, to be ADHD-positive is commensurate with having some sort of medical prescription.

[^10]: There is, of course, the sorts of relationships noted by Levins (2000), where companies may well have good intentions, but are complicated by a network of competing and more primary economic interests. Medical Anthropology has produced an incredible amount of good work on the topic, from the organ transplant industry and epistemology of death (Lock 2001) to psychiatry's racialization of schizophrenia (Metzel 2009).

There is, of course, an overlap with this "need" and the problem of their addiction. To be sure, though, one could have written a similar paper on substance abuse disorder.
