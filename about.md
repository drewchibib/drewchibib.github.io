I studied physics at Reed College in Portland, Oregon before deciding to instead pursue a degree in Cultural Anthropology. I find myself most interested in thinking about the hard sciences and the stuff they produce from an anthropological perspective. I enjoy writing, mostly essays, though I've dabbled in some fiction (I think practicing ethnography gives one quite a lot of good fiction-writing tools). When I'm not injured, I'm an avid runner, and I enjoy making naturally leavened bread and other lacto-fermented food (though I haven't made either for quite some time). I spend my working hours making financial technology products.
