I am twenty five years old, and I make financial technology products. I enjoy writing, mostly because I think I'm good at it. When I'm not injured, I'm an avid runner, and I enjoy making naturally leavened bread and other lacto-fermented foodstuffs (though I haven't made either for quite some time).
