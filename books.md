A running list of books that I've read, am reading, or plan to read. In general, it's just a list of books that I find worth adding to this list - heuristics may vary. 

- [_Working in Public_](https://drewchibib.github.io/2024/04/13/Working-In-Public.html), Nadia Eghball. The making and maintenance of open source software. 
- [_The Dream Machine_](https://www.amazon.com/Dream-Machine-M-Mitchell-Waldrop/dp/1732265119), Mitchell Waldrop, 2018. (review forthcoming). 
- [_Men, Machines, and Modern Times_](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262630184/men-machines-and-modern-times/), Elting Morison, 1968. (post forthcoming. (probably).
