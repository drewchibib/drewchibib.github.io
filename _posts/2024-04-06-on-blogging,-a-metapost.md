First, I'd like to admit that I'm roughly a quarter of a century late to the whole blogging thing, give or take five years. Granted, my exposure to anything remotely adjacent to the world of self-hosted websites (which this, of course, is not), blogging, web-programming, computing, computer science, or anything of that ilk is limited to, like, the last six to eight months. That lack of exposure is, of course, my own fault.

Anyway. This post is meant to be a post about posting. hence the name. There's a few questions that I'd like to address, mostly for my own edification more than anything else. Namely; 
- who is this site for?
- why would I publish content on a blog instead of a social media platform?
- what's the value in publishing any of this content at all?

## who is this site for? 
first and foremost, if the last complete sentence in the above paragraph is any hint, this site is for me. There are likely plenty of ancillary, ad-hoc justifications I could make for why I'm spending some fraction of my free time writing internet content that likely very little (if any) people will read. If I'm lucky, perhaps one day I'll have contributed something (or things) to society at a scale sufficient enough such that people may derive some sort of value in reading what I've written. But I've got nothing really riding on that being the case or not. In the sum of all possible universes, I'm perfectly happy just shouting into the void, recording things I find to be various degrees of compelling, and getting some good writing practice while I'm at it. 

## why would I publish content on a blog instead of a social media platform? 
A corollary of the above answer is that, if I'm optimizing for meeting _my_ needs, at least a fraction of which are comprised of, say, entertainment and writing practice, then I should pursue this activity on a platform which maximizes the expected value of those outputs. I'm sure I could derive plenty of entertainment and writing practice from twitter, but I'm not optimizing for social engagement, and I've made the anectodal assumption that publishing a static website is better suited for long-form writing and information storage. 

## what's the value in publishing any of this content at all? 
Relatively speaking, probably null, depending on how one wants to define and/or measure value. That said, it's making me feel stimulated at the current moment in time, and I'll continue doing it as long as it continues to provide some sort of stimulation (the definition of which could of course change based on one's interests or priorities) more effectively than anything else I do. Maybe I'll suddenly find it incredibly valuable to be able to play the french horn, in which case I'll probably (hopefully, if my brain works the way it's supposed to) drift away from spending time posting content on github pages and spend my time, erm, practicing the french horn.
