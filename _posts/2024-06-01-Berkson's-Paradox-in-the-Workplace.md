title: Berkson's Paradox in the Workplace
---
Had the idea for the following after a conversation with my friend Jack over lunch. 

[Berkson's Paradox ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkson%27s_paradox) is a statistical phenomenon that arises due to a sampling bias in a statistical study design. Here's a great example:  

Let's say that a professor hypothesizes that there's an inverse correlation between mathematical intelligence and verbal intelligence. So they take a bunch of SAT scores from their students and see that, indeed, those with high math scores tend to have lower verbal scores and vice versa. This correlation is spurious, since in general most students make it into a given college with some average test score. If their test score was appreciably better than this average, then they would have gone somewhere else. if it was lower, they wouldn't have gotten in. So, then, the chances that a student with a high math score also has a high verbal score is LESS than it would be in the general population, since we are restricting the selection pool to people that tend to meet some average test score. 

This generalizes pretty well, and has great applications whenever you want to understand intra-population trends v.v. negative correlation of traits within members, when that population passes through some selection process. One such [well documented](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://startupclass.samaltman.com/courses/lec11/%23:~:text%3DPatrick%2520Collison%253A%2520I%2520think%2520a,Expensive%2520from%2520your%2520side.&ved=2ahUKEwjWxb6qqruGAxWg_skDHQXMAeUQFnoECBMQAw&usg=AOvVaw29GLRfA2D1wdZn1VS_poll) process is hiring. 

Every company has some finite set of criteria that they look for in a candidate. The weight/relative importance of those criteria of course depend on the role, the company (their business, their culture, their strategy, and so on), and probably other macroeconomic factors; in general, most probably fall into some permutation of the below categories: 

- General productivity 
- Raw Intelligence 
- Drive/Dedication 
- Agreeableness
- Experience 
- Cultural capital (network, influence, relationship with existing employees)

Acknowledging some obvious caveats where there may actually be a real causal relationship between some traits, or some jobs require one trait more than the other, _in general_, the best employees have more or less maximized all six traits. 

From this we can do some gross oversimplification and claim that the companies which offer the highest pay and the highest degree of fulfillment for workers will generally grab up most of those workers that maximize this trait.  Yes, an individual employee might have some qualms with google on moral grounds and pass up the offer to go work at a start up. Or maybe someone happens to have all six traits maximized, but they love gardening, so they snap up a job that lets them maximize whatever they're selecting for in a job _and_ the time they get to spend gardening. [Markets in everything](https://marginalrevolution.com/?s=markets+in+everything). 

If an employee is incredibly strong in any one of these fields, it's probabilistically more likely that they are lower than average in any of the others, simply because if they _weren't_, they likely would have been promoted or taken an offer at a more prestigious company that pays better. 

I see this pretty reliably at my workplace. Noticing a correlative pattern ("say, why do people with this sort of title generally lack in this quality?") could, without an understanding of how Berkson's paradox works, lead to spurious conclusions like "I guess the more you get paid the less [X] you become". An alternative and statistically more likely explanation is simply that the correlation you observe has nothing to do with a causal link between those traits (ie, your conclusion is wrong) and _everything_ to do with how your company selects for talent. 

To be more specific, people with experience aren't more stupid, it just turns out that if your company can only hire some range of talent (ie, you're not google or amazon or whatever the most desirable employers in your industry are), you have access to a limited pool of candidates that all more or less have equal standing across all traits; so if a candidate has a bunch of experience, and they're _also_ super intelligent and productive and connected, they'd probably get snatched up from the pool by a more desirable employer. So, on net, your coworkers that score particularly well on some traits will, in general, tend to score less well on the other ones. Simple as that. 

### So what? 
Well, first of all, this suggests some particularly odd ways of finding a certain type of employee. If you're looking for a particularly driven and productive worker, for example, you might be better off looking at the ones with less experience - if they got the job with no experience, it's generally more likely that they score well in some of the other traits. 

This seems to imply another application of the ironclad law of tradeoffs. There's no free lunch. That said, there are some systematic methods for exploiting the berkson's paradox in the context of job candidates. I put forth a few here, which have been tweaked slightly from what Scott alexander writes in his [article on the topic](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/03/01/searching-for-one-sided-tradeoffs/)

1. **Insider trading:** where you’re basically just smarter than everyone else, or, at least, you're privy to information that the market isn't. Maybe you’re a brilliant psychologist who has invented a test that invariably reveals a candidates potential. You can find candidates with terrible quantitative measures of those traits that nevertheless have much higher true values for them that everyone else misses, because they're more stupid than you. 
2. **Bias compensation:** where you try and see if other competing companies have biases you can exploit. Maybe you identify that your bank is over-valuing credentials, and thus has some irrational underlying bias against people without a history of working at legacy banks. Since they're not competing for the pool of people without that experience, you can gain expected value by more heavily targeting that pool. Maybe you get a free shot at a few unicorn candidates that competitors auto-rejected 
3. **Comparative Advantage:** maybe you decide you're going to select for one specific quality, and optimize your organization so that deficiencies in the other qualities won't matter. Maybe you want to become the safest and most credentialized custodian on the market, so to optimize for the appearance of safety, you over select for experience and credentials, and build your teams such that a dearth in any other quality doesn't affect you as much. 

What do we do? Well, look in places others aren't, for one - that is, find biases that other people are systemically implementing which you can exploit (maybe the custody industry overfits for credentials, for example). Be conscious of what the market is actually selecting for - maybe you think you've found a bias, but it turns out you're just on the wrong side of someone else's insider trading, e.g. maybe you think you've found a loophole in looking at inexperienced candidates, but actually other competing custodians have some wisdom about the cascading effects of hiring inexperienced candidates that you don't. That said, markets are efficient, [everything is priced in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis), so sometimes you may have to look in seedy places to get some free EV - like [ little-known poultry producers in Mexico](https://www.valueinvestorsclub.com/idea/Industrias_Bachoco/7064788926) or shorting the housing market. 

[Tyler cowen's book on talent](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/forward-thinking-on-talent-state-capacity-and-being-hopeful-with-tyler-cowen) goes into some additional tactics for exploiting this phenomenon to find some EV when hiring talent. The book has been reasonably popular, and the guy has a [pretty big platform](https://marginalrevolution.com), so I expect this will probably have some cascading effects with some companies hiring processes - maybe in a few years when hiring managers have started oversampling inexperienced people you can get some value from going back to picking the oldest candidates with the most experience? 

In closing, here's a fun application of looking for free EV by using the methods above, from the 2014 [Alexander post](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/03/01/searching-for-one-sided-tradeoffs/): 

> An article going around the Internet recently claims houses on streets with mildly rude names (example: “Slag Lane”) [apparently cost](http://www.needaproperty.com/news/whats-in-a-street-name/) £84,000 less than control houses on more properly named streets. If you don’t care about what your street name is called, this might be another potential free trade-off – buy a house on Slag Lane and save $100,000+. Or buy a house that’s supposed to be haunted if you don’t believe in ghosts. Or buy a house near a prison with a very low escape rate because you trust the statistics and other people don’t.
