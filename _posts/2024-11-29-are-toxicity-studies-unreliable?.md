title: Are toxicity studies unreliable? 
---
Maybe. This post is the summary of a very small amount of research I did into the world of evolutionary biology and cellular senescence, which is a very fancy biology word for "getting old". 

It turns out that cellular reproduction is related to cancer, and selection for certain traits is affected by a species' average lifespan. Biologist Brett Weinstein makes an interesting connection on how "artificially" selecting (breeding) a population of mice might relate to their cancer rates, and suggests that this might have some less-than-desireable effects on the quality of studies those mice participate in. 
### Telomeres 
Telomeres are repetitive genetic sequences at the end of chromosomes that don't encode new proteins, but rather serve as some sort of *counter* for cellular reproduction.  
### Hayflick Limit & Senescence 
The [Hayflick limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayflick_limit#:~:text=The%20Hayflick%20limit%20is%20the,at%20the%20end%20of%20chromosomes.) is the limit to how much cells can grow, roughly imposed by the length of the telomeric region at the end of the chromosome. Previously, the idea was that as long as there was sufficient energy and a proper environment, cells could grow indefinitely. 

Why can't they? If you have damage to a tissue (like a cut), cells begin to naturally start to grow until the gap is filled. The problem with this is that every tissue in your body is suddenly in danger of becoming deaf to its neighbors, and therefore unable to stop replicating. Uh oh. You have cancer. 

Roughly speaking, cells evolved a hard limit to reproduction to protect against cancer, implemented through the shortening of the telomere with each cell division. Eventually the telomere reaches a critical length and the cell can no longer reproduce itself. 

The fun conclusion here is that (roughly speaking) the evolutionary solution to protecting against the deadliness of immortality (cancer) is, in fact, *mortality*, in the form of limiting cellular reproduction. Nice. 
### Antagonistic Pleiotropy 
In order to get the small number of genes to produce a complex creature, a gene has to do multiple things (pleiotropy). These effects could be good or bad (contribute to fitness or not). 

- If they're negative late in life, a large number of individuals will die before experiencing or passing on that effect.  
- Because of trade-offs, selection will "see" effects that are good early in life and are negative later, since the positive early-life effects help reproductive fitness before late-life negative effects can hurt it. Basically, selection counts negative effects *less* when they occur later in life. 

Creatures that are poisonous, can fly away, or have other protections can survive much longer than their size would indicate. These creatures have disproportionate longevity because they can escape danger, allowing the species to **select against** negative late-life features.

### Telomeres again? 
In four decades of research, no one could find a molecular mechanism by which antagonistic pleiotropy occurred. Bret Weinstein was looking to prove that it was telomere length. As he was studying, the one blocker to proving his hypothesis about telomeres was that mice were understood (in the literature, at least) to have long telomeres (i.e., lots of cellular reproduction, i.e., longer life) but comparatively normal lifespans. So he went on a lab mice detective mission, and found that most lab mice came from the same breeder in Maryland (or somewhere similar) (citation needed). 

Lab mice breeders are companies, and, like any company, they're beholden to market forces (which, as a fun note, is in itself is a selection mechanism [not unlike evolution](https://gwern.net/backstop)). Any breeder would be stupid not to produce more mice for less cost. This particular lab, which happens to be the main source of lab mice in the US, does so by breeding mice before 8 months, shipping off the offspring as early as possible to minimize housing-expenditure-per-new-mouse. 

But because they all breed so young, the balance for selecting against cancer is minimized since most mice are bred before their cancer-correlating high mitosis limits can effect their evolutionary fitness. 

And because this one breeder is the main source of lab mice, after a while, you get a bunch of unnaturally resilient mice with super young tissue because litter after litter they're selecting for high mitosis limits (and high cancer rates). 

### The Skinny 
Ok, so, to summarize: 

1. Cells have a capacity to heal themselves by "listening" for neighboring cells. If they do not "hear" neighboring cells, they begin to multiply until the gap is filled.  
2. If this process continued indefinitely, even with low mutation rates, it would inevitably lead to a cell losing the ability to "hear" its neighbors. This rogue cell would reproduce without control and create cancerous tumors.  
3. To prevent this, cells evolved a pre-coded limit on their capacity to multiply. This limit is a protective mechanism to keep out-of-control tissue repair at bay.  
4. However, this pre-imposed limit also causes the aging of cells.  
5. Genes have multiple effects (pleiotropy), which can be either beneficial or harmful. Harmful effects expressed earlier in life are less common because organisms with these traits are less likely to reproduce. As a result, *bad* genetic effects tend to accumulate later in a species' life.  
6. Depending on external pressures that affect average lifespan (e.g., predation), different species evolve to balance the benefits of cellular repair (mitosis) and the risks of cancer caused by unlimited cell replication.  
   - Species with shorter lifespans (and less impact of cancer on their evolutionary fitness) prioritize rapid reproduction and robust tissue repair early in life.  
   - Species with longer lifespans (and more impact of cancer on their evolutionary fitness) develop stricter controls on cellular replication to mitigate cancer risks over time.  

7. Market forces favor the rapid breeding of lab mice, leading breeders to select only mice under 8 months old for reproduction. 
8. Because this single population of lab mice make up most of the species, and that population is subject to artificial selection pressure to be reproductively fit at a young age, lab mice with traits that have negative late life effects are favored more than they otherwise would be. 
9. Because those early life traits actually _are_ subject to selection with respect to mitosis, since lab mice are exposed to cellular harm, mice with resilient tissue and high mitosis limits are selected 
10. (8) and (9) would predict that mice would have much longer telomeres relative to their average lifespan, since telomere length (which correlates with mitosis) is pleiotropically related to cancer and other late-life illnesses. 
11. Because those lab mice have evolved extra cellular robustness, toxicity and aging studies on artificially-selected lab mice may have a more-tenuous correlation to humans than we thought, since humans aren't subject to the same selection pressures (ie, cancer factors more in our evolution than in the mice's). 

I don't believe that particular claim has gotten much traction in the scientific community, though I think I'm certainly confident enough to say that there probably needs to be more studies before any stronger claims can be made ([beware the man of one study](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/12/beware-the-man-of-one-study/), etc). For one, the conclusion on this artificial selection phenomena on mice telomeres (which is a premise to the toxicity-test claim) would be cause to expect unreasonably high cancer rates in lab mice. From a cursory review of available studies, it appears that this is not promising: e.g., [one study on 4735 lab mice deaths](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3838613/#sec2) across a couple different strains showed that tumors represented only ~1% of total deaths.
