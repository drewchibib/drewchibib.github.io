title: Keith Basso on Jokes 
---

A review I wrote for Keith Basso's *Portraits of the Whiteman,* a delightful little ethnography on an entertaining trope of the "Whiteman" as a bumbling fool that the Western Apache employ to counterfactually teach some sort of moral comportment. 

### The Review

One gets the sense while reading Basso’s essay/book that they are reading an important work in linguistic anthropology, if not because of the material itself, at least because of the frequency with which it pops up in other work in the discipline (to say nothing of the guy’s peers—he worked with some big names!). All told, though, the essay is a delicately concise assessment of Western Apache models of “the Whiteman.” Dell Hymes, in the foreword, gives one the sense that what follows is a particularly deft work—both in the analytical and literary sense—not only does Basso give the reader a fleshed-out context of that which he analyzes, but he manages to do so while embedding that analysis within and around the forms he’s analyzing. Less so in the novelistic way that Palmer does (Palmer 2003)—in the sense that Basso isn’t engaging in a coy sort of modeling of the object of his ethnography—but rather in that Basso intends for the text to be reflected upon in the same myriad ways that models of the Whiteman call the Western Apache to think about themselves, ‘the Whiteman,’ and general claims about proper moral comportment.

To proceed more methodically, I’ll start with Basso’s words:

> “By learning to appreciate these portraits—by analyzing their symbolic content and attending to what they communicate about aspects of the generic us—we who are Whitemen can develop a sharper and more sensitive awareness of the impressions we make upon persons whose practices for organizing and interpreting social experience differ from our own” (Basso, 1979, p. 5).

To approach these imitations with an understanding that “making fun is making sense” is to appreciate them, and to appreciate them in that way contains something useful, something didactic, something worth writing about.

What of that claim? First, Basso is tasked with the pedagogical problem of communicating an entire cultural sensibility, a litany of associations, intertextualities, and nuances which one must be careful of when thinking about any sort of linguistic play, but especially jokes. To reiterate Hymes’ praise for the care Basso takes to integrate his analysis with a portrayal of the form itself, I’ll note that KHB familiarizes the reader with those linguistic nuances through plenty of “textual” examples.[^1] Theoretically, his point of departure is in treating these imitations as a type of code switching, a code switching which occurs in a particularly formulized and extravagant fashion to signal to others that a certain suspension of normal behavioral codes is about to occur (Basso, 1979: p. 9). There’s also the important note that Whiteman is not merely someone who is white—i.e., the term is doing real work in Basso’s essay, and he capitalizes it for a reason. A ‘Whiteman’ is one who acts like a Whiteman, or, more accurately, one who does not act like an Apache (Basso, 1979: p. 4).

From here, he gives a contextual understanding of the functions of the joke, which, I’ll add, are a useful guide for working through the text itself. First, they critique the butt—not only do the jokes themselves occur in instances where, perhaps, one might be acting a little too much like a ‘Whiteman,’ but they situate the butt in a social relationship not unlike one which they have been subjected to for decades. It’s a very real, culturally situated analogy to a “collision” (Basso, 1979: p. 82) which has caused systemic, material harm. But paradoxically, and Basso takes care to point out these sorts of dualities,[^2] they also serve to advertise the closeness of the joker and the butt. These “dangerous” (Basso, 1979: p. 69) instances of playing with the taboo[^3] are thus an artful, highly contextual form of cultural tightrope walking, best left for experts.

And the experts, in these artful dramatizations, don’t just “delight” but teach—they betray an understanding that:

> “[the jokes] proceed from a mutual affection so strongly felt and fundamentally secure that it can safely risk expression in a manner that transforms its object from the respected companion he is into a figure deserving of no respect at all” (Basso, 1979: p. 75).

But of course (and this is well within the spirit of the upside down, danger-and-delight, profane-and-taboo sort of liminal weirdness that is the world of jokes), the transformation "into a figure deserving of no respect" serves to emphatically reaffirm the strength of the relationship. Only in humor can you express love and respect through degredation. 

So there's two things going on here worth noting: 
1. The sharp distinction between the thing being caricatured (White men) and the negation of that caricature (Apache-ness, roughly), and 
2. A social reaffirmation of the negation, such that the butt, even though they're being likened to their negation, are (in a social-performance-sort of way) being affirmed as close, as kin, as _indeed **not**_ a white man. 

This sort of presents Jokes as an anti-lesson: that is, they display a well-presented model of how a relationship should *not* work (modeling a lack of good comportment, a lack of respect, etc.) to illustrate how a relationship _should_ work. And in the process, they strengthen and reinforce the proper behavior they're highlighting.

Not only are these sorts of jokes a moral cover for what would ordinarily be an immoral act, but they’re a temporary suspension of moral rules for the purpose of making moral claims. These claims are multivalent, and perhaps shouldn't be “read” as just native claims about native texts, but as more broadly useful moral tools. And that these jokes are, in fact, actually _moral_ seems to be one of Basso’s central claims, though it's unclear whether he’s stressing the neutral fact of the jokes doing some sort of social moral work for the Apache, or making a normative claim about the moral lessons those portrayals conceal for _the reader_, as "Whitemen". 

Ultimately, *Portraits of a Whiteman* is both academic and didactic. Perhaps the latter keeps it from being an actually acceptable academic work (and it did read like a novel). The text
forces the reader to reflect in the same ways that Basso presumably did when engaging with the material—one must (certainly one in an undergraduate cultural anthropology class) feel inclined to write something self-aware in the margins next to his description of the garrulous, overenthusiastic, and intruding Whiteman (Basso, 1979: pp. 46-56). But to what end? Certainly, Basso is saying something of the harm that systemic, cyclical epistemic subordination/condescension can have, and the scar tissue left behind by that harm is precisely why these jokes are so dangerous—and so entertaining (Basso, 1979: pp. 71-72). More specifically, though, that harm is something we should attend to, as anthropologists, or even, more generally, as people who might hope for a better future.
