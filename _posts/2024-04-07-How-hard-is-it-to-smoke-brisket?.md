title: How hard is it to smoke brisket? 
---
>Mache, your efforts are to be commended, but you're not going to duplicate Aaron Franklin's brisket. For one thing, the wsm can't duplicate the smoke flavor from Franklin's stickburners. Also, he supposedly uses beef that's superior to grocery store beef. Snake River Farms, is it?
I do like the butcher paper for wrapping for sure, but just because he cooks in small offsets at 250 doesn't mean you can't cook faster. After all, I heard him say in one segment that they cook at 300 in the restaurant. Works for me. No need for the water pan on the wsm for brisket. I've cooked with both, and I bet you anything there's as much moisture in the wsm without water as there is in an offset with water, at least at grate level where it counts. Be all that as it may, I'd sit down to sample your brisket efforts any day! It's addictive, isn't it?! Just wish they weren't so dang expensive!

In celebration (?) of the total solar eclipse (more on that, perhaps, later), I decided I'd try my hand at smoking some meat. I did some research before starting, of course, and it turns out that there's roughly a proportional amount of schools of thought for brisket-smoking as there are for protestant-christian-god-worshipping. 

I went deep into some forums (the above quote is from ["tvwb.com"](https://tvwbb.com/threads/using-aaron-franklins-method-for-brisket.50752/), circa 2014.[^1]

Granted, smoking meat may be a little easier when you have access to a very large meat-smoking apparatus that consists of a giant fire place, no less than 3 insulated metal vaults and thermometers, and plenty of Texas hill-country oak. That said, I'm sure one could quite easily replicate some thermodynamic equivalent by getting a barrel and putting it on top of or adjacent to a fire. 

Anyway. this blog post was partially composed during the cooking of said brisket (about 10 pounds, untrimmed, purchased at Sam's Club). So it could turn out that, in fact, about $100 and 12 hours of work were for naught and brisket-making is, in fact, quite difficult. Jury's still out there. 

[^1]: I'd like to write (I guess another?) blog post on blogging -- there's probably something to be said about how the transition of the _type of internet_ (and the ways of interacting with one another therein) from blogs and forums to platforms is reflective of (or maybe even played a part in shaping) the way that we position ourselves (in the social, or even, I guess, ontological sense) in relation to the world and one another.
